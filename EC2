1. Application Workload Requirements
Questions:
	• What type of workload will run on the instance (e.g., compute-intensive, memory-intensive, storage-heavy, general-purpose)?
      
Different workloads have unique resource needs. For example:
	• Compute-Intensive: Requires high CPU performance (e.g., video encoding, scientific simulations).
	•  Example: A video production company like Pixar renders high-definition animations or movies. Encoding large videos for streaming platforms such as YouTube or Netflix is also compute-intensive.
	• Recommended Instance Types: C-Series (e.g., C5, C6i) in AWS.

	• Memory-Intensive: Demands high RAM (e.g., in-memory databases, big data analytics).
	• Example: Redis or Memcached, used by companies like Twitter for real-time caching and delivering user timelines.
	• Recommended Instance Types: R-Series (e.g., R5, R6g) or X-Series (e.g., X1e).
	
	• Storage-Heavy: Focuses on large storage capacity with high IOPS (e.g., media storage, backup solutions).
	• General-Purpose: Balanced workloads with moderate CPU, memory, and storage requirements.
	• Example: Netflix storing and streaming terabytes of video content, where videos are distributed to users on demand.
	Recommended Storage Options:
		○ EBS Optimized Instances: Instances with provisioned IOPS.
		○ H-Series Instances: (e.g., H1, optimized for storage).
	
      

	• Are there specific performance benchmarks or SLA requirements?
	• Ensures the infrastructure meets predefined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) like uptime or latency.
	• Identifies whether the client has specific goals for latency, throughput, or response times.
• Example Answers from Client:
"Our SLA requires less than 1-second response time for API calls."
"The application must handle 100,000 concurrent users during peak hours."

	• Is the workload stateful or stateless?
	• A stateful workload retains user or session data, often requiring persistent storage and consistent scaling strategies.
	Real-Time Example 1: Online Banking Application
		• Scenario:
			○ A user logs into their online banking account, views their balance, and performs a transaction.
			○ The system must retain the user's session information, account state, and transaction history across requests.
		• Implications:
			○ Requires persistent storage (e.g., databases) to store user and transaction data.
			○ Scaling strategies need to ensure state consistency, often requiring session-aware load balancers or sticky sessions.
			○ Instance types with high IOPS storage (e.g., SSD-backed instances) are preferred.
		• Stateful workloads require consistent performance, persistent storage, and high IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).
	
	• A stateless workload does not retain session information and can scale horizontally with load balancers.
	• This affects instance types, scaling strategies, and data storage requirements.
	Real-Time Example 1: E-commerce Website Catalog
		• Scenario:
			○ A user searches for products on an e-commerce website. The server processes the request, queries the database, and returns results.
			○ No session-specific data is retained; each request is treated independently.
		• Implications:
			○ Can scale horizontally by adding more servers behind a load balancer.
			○ Ideal for auto-scaling as new instances can easily join or leave without state management.
			○ Typically runs on general-purpose instance types (e.g., t3.medium).
		• Stateless workloads prioritize scalability and cost-effectiveness. They benefit from lightweight, horizontally scalable instances.
	

• Example Answers from Client:
"Our video streaming service needs to keep user watch history accessible across devices" (Stateful).
"Our microservices are stateless and rely on external databases for persistence" (Stateless).
	
Information Needed:
	• Workload characteristics (e.g., web server, database, machine learning).
	• Purpose of the Application: Web server, database server, batch processing, machine learning, etc.
	• Specific Features: Does the workload require GPU acceleration, high memory, or fast storage?
	
	• Resource utilization patterns (e.g., consistent or bursty workloads).
	• Consistent Workloads: Applications with predictable resource use, e.g., backend services.
	• Bursty Workloads: Applications with spikes in usage, e.g., e-commerce during sales events.
	

2. Compute Requirements
Questions:
	• How many CPUs (vCPUs) does the application require?
	• Determines the baseline and peak compute needs of the application.
	• Helps in choosing between small instances for light workloads or large, compute-optimized instances for demanding applications.
	• Applications like web servers may need fewer vCPUs, while video rendering or scientific simulations might need dozens.
○ Example Answers from Client:
"Our application requires 8 cores for consistent performance under load."
"A single vCPU can handle our task, but we need to scale horizontally during peak hours."
	
	• What is the expected utilization percentage of the CPU?
	• Helps identify whether to choose burstable instances (like T-series) for low and intermittent utilization or compute-optimized instances (C-series) for high utilization.
	• If utilization is constantly low, cost-effective options like Spot Instances or auto-scaling can be considered.
• Example Answers from Client:
"The application runs at 50% utilization during normal operations, but peaks at 90% during processing jobs."
"It mostly idles but occasionally spikes to 70% for short tasks."
	
	• Does the workload require high-frequency processors or specialized hardware like GPUs or FPGAs?
	• High-frequency processors are essential for latency-sensitive or single-threaded applications.
	• GPUs are critical for parallel workloads like AI/ML, video rendering, and scientific simulations.
	• FPGAs are used for custom hardware acceleration in specialized tasks (e.g., financial trading, genomics).
• Example Answers from Client:
"We need high-frequency processors for real-time data processing with low latency."
"Our application requires GPU acceleration for deep learning model training."
"FPGA is required for custom encryption tasks."
	
Information Needed:
	• Number of vCPUs required.
	• Baseline vCPUs: To handle normal workload levels without delays.
	• Peak vCPUs: For handling surges in demand.
	• Example: "2 vCPUs normally, but up to 16 vCPUs during peak processing."
	
	• CPU utilization behavior (e.g., constant, spiky).
	• Constant Utilization: Suggests instances optimized for consistent performance (e.g., M-series for general use, C-series for compute-heavy).
	• Spiky Utilization: Suggests burstable or scalable instances (e.g., T-series, Auto-Scaling Groups).
	
	• Need for specific processors (e.g., Intel, AMD, or Graviton).
	• Intel Xeon Processors: Ideal for compatibility with legacy systems and applications.
	• AMD EPYC Processors: Cost-effective and suitable for modern workloads.
	• AWS Graviton Processors: ARM-based, energy-efficient, and ideal for cost-sensitive or cloud-native applications.
